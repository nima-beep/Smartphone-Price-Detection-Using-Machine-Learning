# Smartphone-Price-Range-Classification

### AIM

The aim of this project is to classify the mobile phone according to its price in Bangladesh market. This kind of prediction will help companies estimate price of mobiles to give tough competition to other mobile manufacturer specially in Bangladeshâ€™s market. Also it will be useful for consumers to verify that they are paying best price for a mobile with respect to the features they received. 

We will use machine learning technique to classify mobile phones according to some features and attributes in few price range classes like - 

1. Low range ( <10k)
2. Lower mid range (10-25k)
3. Mid range (25-40k)
4. Higher mid range (40-60k)
5. Higher range (>60k)

### Dataset

The dataset we will use to train our classification model is collected from a popular website in Bangladesh named *Mobile Dokan.* 

The website link - [www.mobiledokan.com](https://www.mobiledokan.com/all-brands/)

This script is used to scrape necessary data from the website - https://github.com/SakibAbrar/MobileDokanScraper

Our dataset roughly contains 500 rows. Each row contains all basic and special features of an smartphone. Few of the features we consider are the followings - 1. Brand name, 2. Release Data 3. RAM 4. ROM 5. Network 6. WLAN version, 7. Bluetooth version 8. Display refresh rate, 9. Display protection 10. Chipset 11. Battery capacity 12. Number of sensors etc.

### Tentative algorithms for classification

1. Logistic regression
2. Bayesian classifier 
3. Support vector machines
4. Decision trees, Random forests
5. Neural networks
